Word segmentation is the splitting of sentences into individual words separated by blank spaces. The tokenized units of the sentences are called as tokens. The tokenizers split the sentences into words and punctuations marks as independent units. The most commonly used tokenizer is of space type, i.e. it splits the sentences into words at the blank spaces. It is also required that the tokenizer should consider abbreviations, acronyms, dates, numbers in decimal formats, etc., which cannot split at punctuations and blank spaces, as they will lose their meaning if done so.

The algorithm functions on the basis of the amount of gap or character space between each unit in the sentence. After the calculation of character spaces, an average of the gaps is calculated to know the mean average between characters in the sentence. This average gap distance is then applied to the sentence which is to be segmented. The places at which the character space is more than the average character space are said to be the points of tokenization. The gap between words is always more than the average gap and hence tokenization takes place at the blank spaces between words in the sentences. Naeun Lee et al.

Some of them are explained below. Jerome R. Bellegarda [4] [2010] proposed a method called latent analogy for POS Tagging. In this algorithm, latent semantic mapping (LSM) technique is used.

Once the intent matching sentences are found from the trained data, the POS tags attached to those sentences are then mapped to the test sentences. Liner Yang et al. [5] [2018] put forth the technique of implementing the POS Tagger using Neural Networks. This algorithm consists of ‘n’ numbers of hidden layers. Theses layers are determined by the number of iterations or combinations required to tag the required sentence correctly.

Python NLTK provides an inbuilt Tagger which can be used just by importing the NLTK package. The NLTK has a pre- defined set of tags and a trained data of its own. It tests the sentence and applies an appropriate tag to it. On comparing the above three algorithms, the NLTK tagger proves to be speed and usage efficient.

There are a number of ways by which the parsing can be implemented. The comparison of the same is expressed below. Bo Chen [6] [2011] proposed a method for implementing the dependency tree. It initially finds out the dependencies among the words in the sentence. Each word is checked for its relationship or dependency with the other word. The word with the highest dependency is selected to be the root. The other words with a relation with the root node are attached to it as the child nodes.

In the graph-based dependency parser, the tree created is converted to a graph where the words in the sentences are the vertices and the dependency between the words are the represented by the edges. This data structure shows a better representation of the parsed sentence. Parsing is always to be performed by the traditional method.

The polarity for each feature (word) is then carried out by using the POS tags. If the overall feature polarity is positive, then it can be identified categorically. All the positive features are then grouped together and the synonyms detection for the group of features will be relatively strong, as an entire clause is checked for its synonymic meaning. The synonym sets which are extracted for that clause of features is then calculated for information gain.

This will keep iterating for all users and the tree keeps getting updated for new entries or traces the path available. Naganna Chetty et al. [11] [2015] put forth a fuzzy approach for predictions. In this algorithm, the system follows the clustering mechanism. It means that, the algorithm extracts that data from the knowledge base which is the closest to the user query. When the user fires a query, the algorithm searches for the best matches in the knowledge base and provides the same to the user. In the next iteration, when the user gives the second query, the best matches are further searched for relevance. Each query of the user, filters the matches on every iteration"

It is the process of converting the system produced results into natural language representations which can be easily understood by the user. In other words, NLG is the process of generating text/speech from system generated patterns. The results produced by the system are in the structured format so that they can be easily understood and processed by the system. NLG represents the system knowledge base in a natural or conversational language representation which can be easily understood by the user.

Hence, while providing a response to the user, the NLG unit needs to calculate all the possibilities to interpret the same sentence, and then select the most appropriate one. NLG engine also performs a sequence of tasks to generate sentences. The initial task is to determine the content. It involves the selection of response to be given to the user. This step decides the appropriate content (or set of words) that should be present in the sentence.

Here we highlight the most important features of our eHealth AI chatbot system: 1. The Matrix communication platform, LangChain, as well as the Ollama project, are open-source; 2. The Matrix ecosystem already contains several server and client implementations, so the system administrators can choose which ones to use according to their hardware specifications. The freedom of choice also applies to users, allowing them to choose their web, desktop, or mobile application according to the device they are using; 3. The hardware necessary to run the entire system can be limited to one consumer-grade PC, and as"

Matrix ensures that all the sensitive information transferred from one user to another is encrypted, thus solving an important eHealth issue; 5. Having a decentralized communication platform can provide additional benefits, like security, privacy, data ownership, resilience, independence, and federation; 6. Patients have access to their medical information, prescriptions, and medicine leaflets through an AI chatbot that is securely hosted and only communicates with its users through the Matrix protocol; 7.

Of course, we are not considering other use cases, locations, and variables that fall outside the scope of this paper. In our tests, we found that the very nature of LLMs [52] can be the greatest limitation of our study because the answers can be unpredictable; hence, the reproducibility of the conversation is one of the largest issues. Even though switching LLMs could lead to biased results, we took the decision to design the system this way because the ability to use specific LLMs for certain situations can be extremely useful.

The first step in stopping the LLM’s hallucinations was to force it, through specific prompts, to only answer if it is provided with the relevant information. Due to the nature of how LLMs work, their responses have great variability, and this leads to unclear or even wrong answers, showing that before adopting such technologies in real-world scenarios, more research is needed. 4.

These findings indicate the importance of integrating modern communication methods with AI and eHealth, giving healthcare applications more possibilities to improve our quality of life. Compared to one of the closest implementations we found, our current research is more focused on providing a secure, encrypted, and versatile communications platform (Matrix) in contrast to the limited user interface (Streamlit) used in [49], and using a different LangChain approach where the model can access user-specific medical data instead of a collec"

It is not designed to challenge or replace any framework and is 147 flexible enough to incorporate new ones that will likely be developed. 148 A distinctive feature of our framework is its multi-level tree structure, mapping questions into granular 149 constructs without assigning scores to individual questions. This approach facilitates future development of 150 more detailed, domain-specific evaluation methods, using our framework as a reference or guide. Additionally, 151 we aimed to maintain a consistent level of granularity across all levels of the framework, ensuring that each 152 aspect of evaluation is addressed with equal thoroughness. 153 This approach has several limitations. The framework should be validated prospectively in different contexts to 154 ensure that it is comprehensive and captures important dimensions.

There may be additional dimensions that 155 need to be added as the underlying technology quickly evolves, uncovering new issues. 156 Given the absence of a universal standard for evaluating healthcare chatbots, many parallel review tools have 157 emerged, often failing to capture the full range of important considerations. Our framework addresses this gap, 158 offering a comprehensive, adaptable tool for the evaluation of healthcare chatbots, which we hope will lead to 159 responsible integration of chatbots into healthcare settings. Furthermore, we hope that this review could help 160 guide policymakers to design effective evaluation regulations for healthcare chatbots, both to safeguard the 161 quality of information and provide a clear roadmap for businesses worldwide to further develop tools that 162 improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care. 163 This framework presents a starting poin"

A medical Chatbot or a healthcare Chatbot is nothing but a conversational AI-powered solution specifically designed to make healthcare much more interactive and proactive [10]. 3.1. Types of Chatbot A Chatbot has three types: simple, smart, and hybrid. Simple Chatbots are rule-based, and Smart Chatbots are AI- driven.

An algorithm is a sequence of activities to be processed to get the desired output from a given input. It consists of a finite number of steps to solve a particular problem; each step of the algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously stated. An Algorithm takes zero or more input and produces at least one output. A Chatbot algorithm translates and mimics human conversation through predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, and text classification. It searches for a similar text from previous customer conversations based on predefined responses, and by applying Natural Language Processing, it offers the most appropriate response.

They rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time to solve complex problems and pattern recognition. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are comprised of node layers called neurons, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer [11]. Patterns are introduced into the neural network through the input layer, which contains one neuron for each component in the input data. Information is transmitted downstream from the neuron to other neurons connected to it.

Many studies suggest that chatbots may lack the ability to address complicated clinical scenarios or provide comprehensive diagnostic assessments (13, 17). Cultural and linguistic barriers AI chatbots’ performance can vary significantly based on cultural and linguistic factors. Despite progress in language models, chatbots often struggle with dialects, regional languages, and the subtleties of medical terminology, which can limit their effectiveness in diverse populations (8, 16). These limitations indicate that while AI-powered hybrid chatbots hold promise, they must undergo further development to ensure their reliability, ethical compliance, and practical feasibility across different healthcare settings.

At the same time, the GPT-4o model enhances the retrieval process by refining and contextualizing the retrieved information to produce detailed, human-like responses.

Prompt Engineering Prompt Artisan [11], a widely used custom GPT for co- creation of prompts using best practices, was used in the creation of the default QA system and context prompts suitable for a drug interaction assistant. These prompts are zero-shot style prompts. Using reflections on contemporary prompt engineering techniques such as those in [12], we created 9 prompts for evaluation using two classes generated response sentence limit and comparison/guardrails use as shown in Table 1. For example, prompt_0a is a prompt that has no sentence limit, compares 4 generated results before selecting one and guardrails which are explicit instructions to further reduce the chance of hallucination (no speculation, no unverified sources, clear disclaimer, context- limited responses).

Using a given field query, we compared similarity of Drug_insights response with the response from a pharmacist that used only the corpus accessible by Drug_insights. Similar human and drug insights responses were compared using Sentence-BERT (S-BERT), a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Designed for sentence-level tasks, S-BERT score measures the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings generated by S-BERT; with a higher score indicates a closer semantic relationship between two sentences.

People with greater digital literacy are more likely to benefit from the use of AI and find it easy to use.8 An access gap may be created for people who are less comfortable or familiar with technology as services shift to digital versus in-person access. People who lack reliable access to the internet or smartphones will also experience this gap in care.8 Regulatory Status and Availability There is no existing specific regulatory process to authorize the use of AI-based chatbots for use in Canadian health care.

In 2021, Health Canada, the US FDA, and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency jointly released 10 guiding principles for the development of AI and machine learning in the context of medical devices.9 The intended use of each chatbot will determine which, if any, regulatory requirements it may need to meet to be authorized for use in health care. The use of in-house–developed AI tools or adaptations of free AI software may fall within a regulatory grey area. These principles acknowledge the growing role that AI will play in health care going forward.

Literature Search Strategy An information specialist conducted a literature search on key resources including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the International HTA Database, the websites of Canadian and major international health technology agencies, as well as a focused internet search. The search approach was customized to retrieve a limited set of results, balancing comprehensiveness with relevancy. The search strategy comprised both controlled vocabulary, such as the National Library of Medicine’s MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), and keywords. Search concepts were developed based on the elements of the research questions and selection criteria. The main search concept was AI chatbots. The search was completed on August 14, 2023, and limited to English-language documents published since January 1, 2020."

In this work, we conducted a large-scale 24-week deployment of CataractBot involving 318 patients and attendants who sent 1,992 messages, with 91.71% of responses verified by seven experts. Analysis of interaction logs revealed that medical ques- tions significantly outnumbered logistical ones, hallucinations were negligible, and experts rated 84.52% of medical answers as accurate. As the knowledge base expanded with expert corrections, system performance improved by 19.02%, reducing expert workload. These insights guide the design of future LLM-powered chatbots.

The unprecedented success of LLMs is primarily at- tributed to their ease of use, ability to understand natural language, and extensive knowledge base, which enables them to answer a broad range of questions effectively [29, 39, 56]. These capabilities have led to a widespread adoption of LLMs in end-user applications and chatbots, such as software development [19], healthcare [36], and education [13, 30]. Despite their utility, LLMs have limitations, including hallucinating, providing incomplete or outdated informa- tion, struggling with complex questions, being inconsistent, and exhibiting obscured reasoning and bias [2, 11, 18, 23, 32]"

Such issues are especially concerning in healthcare settings, where accuracy and trustworthiness are critical. Hence, leading organizations like OpenAI and Anthropic have implemented usage policies stating that ‘tailored medical or health advice cannot be provided without review by a qualified professional’ [38]. To address these concerns and comply with these policies, re- searchers introduced an open-source platform ‘Build Your Own expert Bot’ (BYOeB) [37], enabling developers to create expert- in-the-loop LLM-powered chatbots. The platform’s first applica- tion was CataractBot [46], a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to help patients and their attendants with queries related to cataract surgery.

Patients and their attendants seek to understand their health conditions, diagnoses, treatment options, potential risks, and preventive measures [6]. This under- standing has been found to improve their treatment adherence and overall satisfaction with healthcare services [47].

Moreover, the increasing pressure on doctors to accommodate more patients has led to reduced time per pa- tient, negatively affecting communication and information sharing. Studies have shown that doctors often underestimate patients’ in- formation needs and overestimate how much information they provide [31, 48]. These consultations also do not always fully ad- dress patients’ questions due to power imbalances between doctors and patients [17] and the challenge of information overload during these brief interactions [15, 31]. Researchers have explored various technological solutions to bridge the communication gaps between patients and their health- care providers, including phone calls [25], IVRs [28], SMS [42], emails [35, 41], social media chat groups [22, 49], and video calls [12, 21].

We provide a summary here. CataractBot supports three interaction modalities: text, speech, and tap. For every voice message, CataractBot provides both a text and an audio response. For tap-based interactions, the bot suggests three questions with the welcome message and three related ques- tions after each response, enabling users to tap and continue the conversation.

Upon receiving a message, CataractBot classifies it as a medical question (e.g., post-surgery care), logistical question (e.g., scheduling or insurance), or small talk, and responds in real-time. For medical and logistical questions, the bot strictly employs the knowledge base curated by the hospital to generate an appropriate response, which is marked as unverified. When the custom knowl- edge base lacks an answer, the bot responds with a template “I don’t know” response. For small talk messages (such as “Hello” or “Thank you for the info”), CataractBot provides corresponding small talk responses. For medical questions, the operating doctor receives a message, including the question asked, the bot’s response, and patient’s demo- graphics.

This indicates that more logistical questions were misclassified as medical, rather than the reverse.

Taps were also preferred over speech (p<0.001). The reluctance to use the speech modality may stem from concerns about the bot’s limited transcription capabilities or privacy issues [46].

Thematic analysis of the experts’ corrections (Figure 2C,D) revealed nine distinct types, with the four most common described here. First, ‘Adding new information’ (Figure 2C,D) was the most frequent correction type for both medical (65.85%) and logistical (30.45%) questions, wherein experts introduced new information that the bot lacked. This category primarily addressed the bot’s “I don’t know” responses, constituting 49.28% of such corrections. Second, experts performed ‘Factual corrections’ more frequently for medical answers (7.80%) compared to logistical answers (2.06%). These medical corrections often reflected expert-specific preferences.

Third, experts included ‘Clarifying questions’ in 9.38% of corrections. This was primarily because 22.43% of the bot’s “I don’t know” responses were due to unclear or incomplete questions. For instance, when faced with unclear questions due to translation or transcription issues, expert often requested, “Please repeat the question, what do you mean?’. Similarly, in response to patient-specific questions, such as about lenses or surgery schedules,rts asked: “Please share your MRN number [patient identification number]”.

It should then engage in multi-turn conversations with users to gather necessary clarification or en- able them to build complex requests, before relaying the exchange to the expert for verification. Additionally, CataractBot currently considers only the last two queries when generating a response. Prior work has mentioned the benefits of integrating long-term conversational history into LLM systems, enabling proactive follow- ups and more tailored recommendations [40, 56]. Incorporating a long conversation history is challenging due to token limitations in LLM inputs, hence generating conversational summaries"

Incorporating a long conversation history is challenging due to token limitations in LLM inputs, hence generating conversational summaries could be explored as an alternative approach. Knowledge Base. In our deployment, we observed that multiple different answers to the same or similar questions were sometimes added to the knowledge base. We propose that those managing the knowledge base of informational bots, should have a clear overview of existing content in relation to the new question, to make an in- formed decision. Additionally, previously rejected questions should not be resubmitted to the update expert. We also noticed that these differing answers were mainly due to varied recommendations based on individual doctors’ preferences. To avoid contradictions, we suggest creating expert-specific partitions within a broader knowledge base. Standard subjective answers could even be param- eterized, allowing experts to proact"

This decentralization of knowledge base control would reduce the burden on a single knowledge base update expert and democratize such expert-in-the-loop systems to account for the voices of individual experts. Translation and Transcription. We found that transcription and translation errors, along with minimal use of audio messages, high- light the need for improvements in the services used. For future deployments of LLM-powered bots, particularly in low-resource languages, we propose the following enhancements: (a) Implement a dictionary of common errors across languages to serve as a look- up resource. (b) Provide the LLM with both the original language version and its English translation of each query, for improved an- swer generati"

(d) Offer experts access to the original audio of the user’s question on demand, in addition to the trans- lated text, as recommended by Ramjee et al. [46]. These serve as additional safeguards in cases where language technologies fail. However, Wei et al. [51] caution that the advantages of using rich audio data must be balanced against privacy risks, as voice messages may unintentionally transmit personal information or identifiers. It is essential to ensure that users are fully aware that their original audio messages will be shared with experts. Limitations. Our study has a key limitation.

While the in-the-wild setting at Sankara Eye Hospital enabled scalability, it limited our control over participant recruitment and training. We could not ensure the accuracy of participant data, such as phone numbers, during onboarding. The inconsistent training methods and reliance on manual explanations from patient coordinators may have con- tributed to some onboarded participants not engaging with the bot, resulting in their exclusion from the study. 6 CONCLUSION We conducted a large-scale in-the-wild 24-week deployment study of CataractBot, involving 318 patients and attendants who sent 1,992 messages, receiving responses verified by seven experts.

Our analy- sis revealed that both patients and attendants predominantly used the bot to address their medical questions, focusing on predictable themes such as precautions and dos and don’ts post-surgery. Their activity peaked on the day before surgery. CataractBot rarely hal- lucinated, accurately classified questions and incorporated expert corrections. Experts rated 84.52% of its medical answers as accu- rate and complete. Their corrections mainly involving adding new information, which reduced CataractBot’s “I don’t know” answers by 7.84% and improved its accuracy and completeness by 19.02% over the study period. We note, however, that experts often ignored patient-specific questions due to a lack of incentives, as these non- generalized inputs would not be added to the knowledge base to reduce their future workload. To address this, we emphasize the importance of integrating such bots with institutional sources of user-specific information. Finally, as the knowledge base"

RELATED WORK Symptom checkers for patient navigation have gained in- creasing attention as tools to improve the accuracy and ef- ficiency of the diagnosis of medical conditions [43]. Their development has been particularly important in public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where timely mon- itoring and rapid response are essential. For example, [30] highlighted how the symptom checkers maintained public safety by tracking and reporting infection trends. Similarly, [50] demonstrated that platforms like Symptoma provided early warnings of COVID-19 spread, offering alternative data sources for policymakers and often anticipating official reports.

For example, [35] evaluated Flo Health’s symptom checkers to identify conditions such as en- dometriosis, uterine fibroids, and polycystic ovary syndrome. They reported high diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that these tools could reduce time to diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

In this phase, we use a doctor-patient conversation dataset designed to simulate realistic medical interactions and con- sultations [11]. The objective here is to enhance the model’s capability to engage effectively in multi-turn dialogues. This fine-tuning ensures that the model can accurately interpret and respond contextually to complex, prolonged medical conversa- tions.

It covers over 2,400 healthcare topics across 21 distinct medical subjects, serving as a valuable resource for medical entrance exam preparation and comprehensive medical train- ing. 2) Medical Dialogue Datasets: Doctor-patient dialogue scenarios typically occur in outpatient clinical settings, mak- ing these data challenging to collect. Existing open-source datasets, such as MedDialog [49], usually contain single-take conversations that focus primarily on diagnoses and treatment recommendations. This structure significantly differs from the conversational objectives of this paper, which aims to facilitate natural, multi-turn interactions between patients and medical guidance systems."

This structure significantly differs from the conversational objectives of this paper, which aims to facilitate natural, multi-turn interactions between patients and medical guidance systems. To address these limitations and align more closely with the requirements, without loss of generality, we used a random sample of 5000 conversations from the DDXPlus dataset (data_5k_ddxplus). DDXPlus is a comprehensive dataset comprising approx- imately 1.3 million patient cases, each containing differen- tial diagnoses, confirmed pathologies, detailed descriptions of symptoms, and patient medical history [11]. Unlike traditional datasets that typically contain binary symptom indicators, DDXPlus provides categorical and multi-select symptom data organized hierarchically, which significantly facilitates logical and interactive patient conversations.

To ensure clarity and promote natural human-like interactions, these queries were carefully rewritten using patient-friendly language. Medical terms were specifically avoided during the rewriting process, reflecting real clinical scenarios in which physicians typically use layman’s terms to facilitate patient understanding.

Improper formatting can lead to performance errors even in adequately trained models. A crucial aspect distinguishing conversation tuning from general text fine-tuning is the use of special end-of-turn markers.

One of the best-known examples of chatbots in recent history is Siri the AI assistant that is part of Apple's standard software for its products. Siri took chatbot mainstream in 2011. Since then, brands in every sector have started to use them, eventually developing a new trend conversational in user experience. This refers to an end-user experience in which your interaction with a firm or service is automated based on user prior behaviour.

When doctors entered the wrong data on their database, the responses of chatbot are not relevant. These above techniques are used to correct the information and give proper response to a patient in form of text. III. LITERATURE REVIEW The literature review plays an important role in understanding the artificial intelligence domain and implementation of the working system. We have included three literature survey papers with proper explanations. In this paper,MeghaManilal, Shobana AJ, Belfin RV have explained the usage of healthcare chatbot for cancer patients [3]. This paper explains that the cancer can be detected at an early stage. Detection of cancer at an early stage helps to cure the disease and save the patient’s life. Most of the people detect the cancer at the last stage. Cancer is a disease"

Initially, chatbot created for interact with human for entertainment purpose only. Today in the present era, the major challenges that India as a country is facing is to cater good quality and affordable healthcare services to its growing population and at the same time, they are not cost efficient. This inaccessibility of healthcare facilities especially in rural areas and the difficulty in accessing means of transport and it causes patients to postpone their treatment, or option for medical facilities which is closer but at the same time are not cost-efficient and well-matched to their medical needs.

LITERATURE REVIEW Imagine you're feeling unwell and reach out to a healthcare centre for help. You might get stuck waiting for a real person to answer, which can be super frustrating. Even worse, using the chat or making a phone call sometimes costs money, adding to the already stressful situation. But even if you avoid those snags, accessing healthcare often isn't easy. It might take ages to see a doctor or even get an appointment. This is especially true in rural areas, where there aren't enough healthcare workers.

Ultimately, where you live, how much money you have, and your social background can all affect how easily you get medical help. This unfairness means access to healthcare isn't equal for everyone, which is definitely a problem. So, while healthcare chatbots can be helpful, they also highlight the existing challenges and inequalities in receiving medical assistance. We need to find ways to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone, no matter where they live or how much they earn. 3.

Selection of Operating System: We have used the Windows as a operating system. While Windows can be user-friendly for some, it's not necessarily the standard choice for development, especially for chatbots. Linux and macOS often offer greater flexibility and stability for server-side applications like chatbots. Robustness is relative and depends on specific hardware and usage. Both Windows and other operating systems can be robust if configured and maintained properly. B.

II. BACKGROUND ON AI-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE CHATBOTS Modern conversational agents in healthcare leverage computational linguistics and machine learning to simulate nuanced, context-aware dialogues. By integrating methodologies like emotional tone assessment (to interpret user sentiment), query categorization (e.g., distinguishing symptom inquiries from administrative requests), and keyword identification for clinical terminology, these tools streamline patient engagement. Cutting-edge neural network frameworks, trained on extensive datasets of historical patient interactions, refine their ability to generate relevant, personalized responses."

While emotional intelligence is proven to build trust in patient-provider relationships, most chatbot systems today prioritize efficiency over empathy. This creates a disconnect—patients often feel unheard when interacting with rigid, formulaic bots. Closing this gap isn’t just about upgrading algorithms. It requires rethinking how chatbots are built. For instance, a bot designed for mental health support should recognize subtle cues like hesitation (“I’ve been feeling… never mind”) and respond with validating language, not just clinical advice.

Consider a tribal community in Odisha, India, where a chatbot trained on urban Hindi datasets misunderstands local Santali terms for fever (\"jwar\" vs. \"lohra\"), leading to incorrect advice. Or take a mother in Lagos who masks her chest pain as indigestion during a chat, fearing stigma; the bot’s rigid algorithms miss her anxiety-laden cues, delaying cardiac care. Such gaps reveal deeper flaws. Systems designed for Western contexts falter in Global South settings, where socio-linguistic diversity demands hyperlocal adaptation. While automating appointment bookings saves time, over- reliance on these tools risks missing silent emergencies— like a daily wage worker skipping a clinic referral due to a bot’s dismissive tone.

For chronic conditions like diabetes, a bot might track daily glucose levels via wearable devices, flagging anomalies for nurse follow-up rather than acting autonomously.  Transparency and Accountability: Developers must publish audit trails showing how algorithms prioritize data.

Among the chronic illness investigated, cancer, including breast cancer, post-cancer treatment and geriatric oncology, was the subject of investigation in four studies [14,26,27,32].

Description of AI-powered chatbots interventions Table 2 presents an overview of the technologies uti­ lized to support chatbots, including independent platforms, web or mobile applications. Out of the eight AI-powered chatbots considered in this review, all studies were classified as chatbots, which are software systems designed to emulate human conversation through voice or text-based interactions. Three studies were not specified in AI methods [14,28,30]. Table 3 presents the characterization of AI-powered chatbots as described in the reviewed papers. The chatbots dis­ cussed in these papers employed a range of AI tech­ niques, such as speech recognition and NLP, to facilitate their functionality.

A recent systematic review assessed the effects of automated telephone communication systems, which lack natural language understanding, on preventive healthcare and chronic condition management. This review by Posadzki et al. [33] indicated that these sys­ tems have the potential to enhance specific health behaviours and improve health outcomes. Notably, advancements in dialogue management and NLP tech­ niques have surpassed the rule-based approaches prevalent in the studies included in our investigation [14,28,30]. While rule-based approaches in finite-state dialogue management systems have a straightforward construction process and are suitable for well-structured tasks, they restrict user input to predefined words and phrases, limiting the user’s ability to initiate dialogues and correct misrecognized elements [34]. In contrast, frame-based systems provide enhanced capabilities for system and mixed-initiative interactions, allowing for a more flexible dialogue structure [34]."

Furthermore, AI-powered chatbot interventions offer clients the prospect of accessing healthcare services in geograph­ ically isolated or remote areas, obtaining support ear­ lier in the progression of a disease, and curbing the expenses associated with physician visits [38]. Additionally, health professionals stand to gain from these interventions as they enable more efficient access to patient data, ultimately leading to time sav­ ings for physicians. This, in turn, allows them to allo­ cate more attention to critical cases demanding urgent treatment. The utilization of AI-powered chatbots in automat­ ing healthcare activities and promoting consumer self-care is projected to grow as they become more capable and dependable [21].

The impact of automation on human activities has serious safety consequences, with the hazards varying depend­ ing on the extent of automation and the individual automated functions used [39]. Therefore, it is imperative to exercise careful monitoring of the utiliza­ tion of AI-powered chatbots with unrestricted input capabilities of natural language, as well as other AI applications, in the healthcare domain [40]. By closely monitoring these advancements, potential safety con­ cerns can be addressed and mitigated effectively. Remarkably, existing research on AI-powered chat­ bots lacks a comprehensive social-systems analysis, a gap that has also been identified in previous literature examining AI applications [41]. Currently, there is a lack of agreement on the approaches utilized to eval­ uate the lasting impacts of this technology on human populations. It is essential to a"

It is essential to acknowledge the poten­ tial for biased design in these applications, as they can reinforce stereotypes or have disproportionate effects on already marginalized groups, influenced by factors such as gender, race or socioeconomic status. Therefore, it is vital to consistently incorporate a consideration of the social implications of AI-powered chatbot at all stages, from their inception to their practical imple­ mentation. Neglecting this aspect may lead to adverse outcomes for the health and well-being of certain populations. Limitations However, it is crucial to acknowledge some limitations in the reviewed studies.

Hence, having a trustable source which can give us the information and solution needed can help us in taking care of our health and saving our time. Surveys done across different age groups showed that that people with their age ranging from 18- 60 have a very bad report of regularly going to their doctor’s clinic for regular checkups, and majority of the reason points out to busy schedule for the given statistics.

Chatbots are programs that simulate human-like conversations. They utilize AI technology, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) to assess the user input and provide an appropriate output (response) [1, 2]. When a chatbot is AI-powered, it is capable of handling complex conversations and can learn from different user interactions. This enables them to make sense of various types of unstructured input. This is in contrast to the earlier rule-based systems, which were only able to respond if a certain structured input was used.

While chatbots have certain limitations (limited diagnostic capabilities, a lack of empathy and human touch, an inability to conduct and appraise physical examinations, and technical limitations), users can achieve optimal responses by understanding the algorithmic flow of chatbot conversations. The user initiates the interaction by providing input, referred to as a prompt. This prompt serves as the main query and establishes the context for the chatbot's output. It is important to note that chatbot conversations are iterative, involving multiple interactions. This means that building context through multiple prompts can lead to the desired response. This has given attention to what has been termed “Prompt engineering,” which refers to refining instructions or prompts that effectively obtain various responses from chatbots [3].
